📊 S Index: A Quantifiable Metric of Scholarly Impact with Data Sharing Incentives

This repository provides an executable, extensible framework to compute the S Index — a composite, real-time metric for quantifying researcher impact. It draws on structured metadata from Semantic Scholar, Figshare, and other repositories, integrating structural, semantic, temporal, and data-sharing dimensions.

🔍 What is the S Index?

The S Index is a weighted composite score (scaled 0–100) that captures the scholarly contribution of a researcher by combining four key categories:
	•	📐 Structural Metrics (40%): Graph-theoretic features from citation networks (connectivity, centrality, clustering, PageRank).
	•	🧠 Semantic Metrics (30%): Embedding-based similarity of abstracts, knowledge completeness, ontological diversity.
	•	📦 Data Sharing Metrics (15%): Open science participation via dataset uploads (e.g., on Figshare).
	•	⏱️ Knowledge Update Metrics (15%): Frequency and volume of recent knowledge additions to the graph.

🥕 The Carrot Effect: Why Researchers Should Care

The S Index rewards data sharing explicitly:

📈 Each dataset openly shared increases the S Index, providing researchers with tangible incentives for open science.

Benefits include:
	•	Increased visibility and academic reputation.
	•	Better chances for grants, collaboration, and promotion.
	•	Real-time feedback via dashboards showcasing how actions (like dataset sharing) improve the score.

⚙️ Architecture Overview

Data Sources → Unified Graph → Metrics Engine → S Index → Dashboards

	•	Data Ingestion: Pulls papers and citations via the Semantic Scholar API, and datasets via the Figshare API.
	•	Graph Builder: Constructs a timestamped, directed citation graph with embedded text.
	•	Metric Engine: Computes individual scores using normalized mathematical formulations.
	•	S Index Calculator: Applies fixed weights to produce a single interpretable score.
	•	Carrot Effect Logic: Tracks and rewards new shared datasets to boost the score transparently.

📦 Features
	•	Full knowledge graph construction with metadata
	•	Abstract embedding and similarity scoring
	•	Explicit timestamp-based knowledge update scoring
	•	Objective reward mechanism for data sharing
	•	Extensible to additional APIs and ontologies

🚀 Getting Started

pip install -r requirements.txt
python s_index.py

You’ll need:
	•	A Semantic Scholar author ID
	•	Researcher name string (to query Figshare)

📈 Example Output

Author's S Index: 68.75
Data Sharing Score: 0.90 (6 datasets shared)
Structural Score: 0.65
Semantic Score: 0.72
Knowledge Update Score: 0.45
