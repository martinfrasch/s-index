# **The Incentive Mechanism of the QIC-Index**

The QIC-Index is designed to create a direct and tangible incentive—a "carrot"—for researchers to engage in high-quality data sharing and collaboration. It addresses the "incentive gap" left by traditional metrics by rewarding the specific behaviors that foster open science.

## **How the Incentive Works**

The multiplicative formula, **s \= Q × I × C**, ensures that value is only created when a contribution is holistic. This incentivizes a shift in focus:

1. **From Just Sharing to Sharing Well (Quality):** Researchers are rewarded for creating well-documented, accessible, and reusable data (i.e., data with a high FAIR score). Simply uploading a poorly documented file yields a low Q score and thus a low reward.  
2. **From Data Silos to Impactful Reuse (Impact):** The metric rewards the *actual reuse* of data by the scientific community. This encourages researchers to share data that is relevant, important, and easy for others to find and use.  
3. **From Individual Credit to Valuing Teamwork (Collaboration):** The C score explicitly rewards teamwork, particularly across multiple institutions. This provides a formal mechanism to value the contributions of individuals on large, collaborative "team science" projects, whose work is often undervalued by traditional publication metrics.

By making these currently invisible contributions visible and valuable, the QIC-Index provides a clear signal to researchers, hiring committees, and funding agencies about what constitutes a meaningful contribution in modern, data-driven science.
